Box 1 - 
Column 1 & 2 appear to be shorted

Box 2 -
All appear empty

Box 3 -
Okay

Merged logic-board from Box-1 with firing-board from Box-2 - Box 1 now appears okay.

Box 2 has a short on the firing board, and appears to have an open on the logic board.

Logic board had a dry pin (U3.8) - hit it with an iron and now it is functioning.
